Working for iOS8.2
Began the updates to get it working for iOS 8.2
So far so good.
This version of the code plays the stream, and displays the meta data. Title / track etc. and bit rate.
It's pretty crude still, but you will get the picture.
No storyboards added yet, and I can't get it to display ogg or acc titles. MP3 from Shoutcast/Icecase is fine
